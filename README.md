🏎️ Power BI & Data Projects Repository
This repository showcases a collection of original data projects—ranging from Power BI dashboards to Python-based data automation tools—developed to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, data modeling, and interactive storytelling. Each project is independently conceptualized and built to extract actionable insights through effective visualizations and automation workflows.

📌 Objectives
Apply end-to-end development: data extraction, transformation, modeling, and reporting

Automate data collection processes to support real-time or repeated analysis

Explore real-world and sports datasets to uncover meaningful trends

Design clean, intuitive, and insightful dashboards

Strengthen business and analytical thinking through practical use cases

🛠 Tools & Skills Used
Power BI Desktop – for dashboard development

Power Query (M) & DAX – for data transformation and modeling

Python (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Pandas) – for data scraping and preprocessing

Data modeling best practices

Automation and workflow optimization

📁 Project List
Project	Description	Status
Formula 1 Free Practice Scraper	Automates extraction of FP1–FP3 session data from Formula1.com for analysis	🛠 In Progress

Each project includes relevant code, PBIX files (for Power BI dashboards), screenshots, and case documentation to explain the business context, data logic, and outcomes.

🔍 Spotlight: Formula 1 Free Practice Data Scraper
This Python-based tool automates the collection of Free Practice (FP1, FP2, FP3) session results directly from the official Formula1.com website. It allows users to generate clean, structured CSV files for use in Power BI, Excel, or any analytics workflow.

Key Features:

✅ Extracts all three FP sessions using a single FP1 link

✅ Automatically handles scrolling, dynamic loading, and modal popups

✅ Saves data in clear, track-specific CSV formats

✅ Built using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas

📈 Applications: Performance trends, driver/team comparisons, race weekend summaries, and Power BI dashboards.
