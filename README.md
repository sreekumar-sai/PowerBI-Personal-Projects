Project	Description	Status
Formula 1 Free Practice Scraper	Automates extraction of FP1–FP3 session data from Formula1.com for analysis	🛠 In Progress

Each project includes relevant code, PBIX files (for Power BI dashboards), screenshots, and case documentation to explain the business context, data logic, and outcomes.

🔍 Spotlight: Formula 1 Free Practice Data Scraper
This Python-based tool automates the collection of Free Practice (FP1, FP2, FP3) session results directly from the official Formula1.com website. It allows users to generate clean, structured CSV files for use in Power BI, Excel, or any analytics workflow.

Key Features:

✅ Extracts all three FP sessions using a single FP1 link

✅ Automatically handles scrolling, dynamic loading, and modal popups

✅ Saves data in clear, track-specific CSV formats

✅ Built using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas

📈 Applications: Performance trends, driver/team comparisons, race weekend summaries, and Power BI dashboards.
